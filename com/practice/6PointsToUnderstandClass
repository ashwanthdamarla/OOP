An instance of a class knows what class it is from

Vars defined in the class are avaiable to the instance

A method on an instance passes instance as first argument to the method( named self in the method)

Instances has its own data, called instance attributes

Variables defined in the class are class attributes

When we read an attribute, Python looks for it first in the instance and then in the class
